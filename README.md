# How to Deploy with Free Python Hosting Services

### PythonAnywhere's Free Tier Highlights

* Free (larger capacity than Heroku as long as you're not using too much console time)
* MySQL only
* Console-based

### Step by Step

This will follow along with the process I demoed during our option class lecture. (If available to you, you can find this on 18-3 in Bootcampspot or your lecture overview.)

#### 1. Create a free account on PythonAnywhere

The account you create will be the only way for you to manage your server.

For groups, you should consider that if you use one member's personal account, you may lose access to your server after class if they need to use their account for something else.

An alternative is to create a shared email account that all of you will have access to. Another advantage of this method is that you won't have to use your own personal project hosting resources for the group.

If you do choose to create a shared account, you can create a fake email address, or a real one. If you choose to use a fake email service, remember you will not be able to recover your account if you lose the password.

#### 2. Sync your project to git

If you haven't already, make sure your project runs locally and is synced to git.

You can also clone the project you're reading now.

#### 3. Clone your git repo onto PythonAnywhere

Open a console on PythonAnywhere. This console works just like the gitbash console you're used to, but is only accessible on your web browser.
